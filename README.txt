Control your Velux blinds, shutters, and windows with ease from your Homey smart home hub that works without internet/cloud access. 

Instantly adjust your homeâ€™s light, privacy, and comfort to suit your mood or daily routine, whether you want to block out the morning sun or let in fresh air. This app makes it simple to automate your Velux devices and enjoy a more comfortable, personalized living environment every day.

Please note: This app requires a Velux KLF-200 gateway and does not support the VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO solution.
